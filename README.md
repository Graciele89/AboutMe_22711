## Introduction
About Me app is an application created to introduce a little bit about myself as well as for practise 
what we have been doing in classes during this semester.

## Difficulties | challenges
The biggest problem was to make the emulator run. As my laptop only have 8gb ram, the machine keep stuck most of the time, :angry: 
another challenge was fixing the errors, soon as you fixed and changed in one tab the other was giving error.
Before I share this project in GitHub, I deleted everything and started from scratch three times, it is frustrating when you see a 
video and follow the same steps and you get completely different output, this when it runs at all. 
Another very hard challenge, at least for me, is work with GitHub, but with time I suppose things get easier.
My first attempt i could not even positioning the buttons or text views in the right place, till I understand how linear Layout works
and what each command does was another ten times watching and watching class again.
The scroll view took all my patience away, because when I finished to centralize and put everything in place and I thought if I cut it 
and add the scroll view inside the activity and paste everything inside it would work... well, not that easy :lol:, and to be honest, 
from the first to the last item of the least, was not anything I could do and make work right at first.

## Last considerations:
Even thought I struggled a lot for do this project, 
when you see the final result and see that is running in any android, 
the feeling it's unexplainable :joy: each button who make work it is a victory.
And all you keep is that more you practice, better you get!
